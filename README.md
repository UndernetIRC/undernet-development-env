## Service information (hosts, ports and login information)

The following ports below are mapped from your host to the container:

| Service      | URL / ip:port                                        | Comments                                                                                                                                                                    |

# Configuration

The configuration for the `hub`, `leaf` and `gnuworld` can be changed in the folder `etc/`.
All the files are mounted inside the container as volumes, so any change done on your host
is reflected in the container immediately. For example after changing `etc/hub.conf`, just 
`/rehash` the IRC server to apply the changes.

For the service `cservice-web` the configuration can be changed from `cservice-web/php_includes`. Any configuration
or code change will be applied immediately.

# Making code changes in ircu or gnuworld

After making any code change in either ircu or gnuworld the container need to be rebuilt and restarted.

Rebuild ircu (hub and leaf share the same image):
```
docker-compose build hub
docker-compose restart hub
docker-compose restart leaf
```

Rebuild and restart gnuworld:
```
docker-compose build gnuworld
docker-compose restart gnuworld
```


# FAQ
Q: Why do I see this message _"X (cservice@undernet.org): AUTHENTICATION FAILED as <user> 
   (Unable to login during reconnection, please try again in 295 seconds)"_ when trying to 
   authenticate with `x@channels.undernet.org`?

A: This is a burst connection mechanism in GNUworld which happen when it links to its hub. 
   Just wait for it to complete and try again. Or you can change the setting `login_delay` in
   `etc/gnuworld/cservice.conf`, it's currently set to 5 seconds.
